This is a WEBGL audio visualiser using P5JS loadImage(),  loadSong()  and mousePressed() functions to play pre recorded interviews which are asking working class creatives to reimagine what the world would be like without technology or what the world can be like for jobs and creatives in a world where AI deems our work and roles unneccesary.
